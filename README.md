# MongoDB & Web Scraper - Synonyms and Antonyms

## What is this?

"MongoDB & Web Scraper - Synonyms and Antonyms" is an API server with a web scraper and a MongoDB driver. This project is just to show off a **very basic** knowledge of Web Scrapers and MongoDB while making something fun.

The program firstly tries to find the definition on the database, if nothing can be found, it uses the web scraper to search for the synonym/antonym, as chosen by the user.

## How to test?

- Clone the repository;
- Inside, execute `npm install` to install every dependency;
- Then, run `npm run dev` and open the browser at `http://localhost:4000`;
- This is it. Have fun *(if you can)*.
